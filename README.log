FINAL VERSION

Welcome to your new Minecraft Server control panel, produced by the TXP-Network. This app is currently in A-04 stage of development (Alpha-Development - Complete). Therefore, this alpha version is the intended final product. This control panel is made to supplement the default server software provided by Mojang (at minecraft.net) and Minecraft Forge-based servers only. Therefore, you will need to have a server already available for testing. In order for your copy of TXP-MC Server Admin to work correctly, please place all server files into the folder "/server/", enable PHP 5.4 and higher, use a modern browser to access the CPanel ("cpanel.html"). It is also required that you rename the server jar to "minecraft_server". This also CPanel requires that your Minecraft server will be running somewhere on an HTTP/HTTPS webserver (online location/website/local web server), with (optional) access to a standard JVM (preferably, Linux). This software comes with no warranty of any type (not even implied). Please use with caution.

NOTE: If you can convert the .jar file to a working, independent, executable binary, do so. That removes a step from installation, and a requirement from your runtime: JRE/JVM/Java installation...
